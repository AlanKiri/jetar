# Project

As a programming intern, I was required to maintain and develop an order management system used by a number of factories in different countries. The application wasn't weighed down with unnecessarily complex solutions but had to offer speed, reliability, and maintainability to users at the point of delivery, something that was a challenging feat to achieve with its WordPress technology stack.

## What I Did

- Created front-end applications from scratch with maintainable and reusable components in mind.
- Cooperated very closely with backend developers.
- Researched slow load times and refactored complex data structures to improve speed and maintainability.
- Maintained legacy codebases with lots of low-quality and undocumented code.
- Employed Stripe to deploy payment systems.
- Added new functionalities to users such as enhanced product systems, order galleries, chats, file drives, and more.
- Managed server installations of Linux, NGINX configuration, domain setup, and SSL certificates.
