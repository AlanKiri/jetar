# Project

As a programming trainee i was assigned to maintain and develop an order management system used by multiple factories in different countries. The app wasn't flooded with overextreme complex solutions but it's main task was to provide speed, reliability and maintenance to end users which was challenging task considering it's wordpress tech stack.

---

## The Fight Against Tech Debt

Time went by, new functionality was required but creating a fast yet maintable product with php was unnatural so a choice to rewrite frontend into react was taken. This required to transit wordpress into headless mode creating a new wordpress RESTFUL api almost from scratch. This decision

### Challenges

- **Ethical Design**: AI systems may unintentionally reinforce biases. Designers must ensure inclusivity and fairness.
- **Loss of Control**: Relying too heavily on AI can dilute the human touch in design.
- **Learning Curve**: Integrating AI tools requires new skills, which can be daunting for some designers.

### Opportunities

- **Enhanced Creativity**: AI can inspire by offering unconventional ideas.
- **Efficiency Gains**: Automation allows for rapid iteration and prototyping.
- **Scalability**: AI enables personalized experiences at scale, a growing demand in today’s market.

## Design Engineering: The Glue Between Creativity and Execution

Design engineering ensures that the gap between creative vision and technical execution is seamless. It combines the artistry of design with the precision of engineering.

### Key Principles of Design Engineering

1. **Systems Thinking**: Viewing a design holistically ensures all components work together cohesively.
2. **Collaboration**: Effective communication between designers and developers is crucial for successful outcomes.
3. **Iterative Process**: Building, testing, and refining are fundamental to achieving the best results.

> "Good design is as little design as possible." — Dieter Rams

### Tools of the Trade

Modern design engineers leverage tools like:

- **Figma** and **Sketch** for prototyping
- **Motion** for creating smooth animations
- **Tailwind CSS** for streamlined styling
- **Git** for version control and collaboration

---

## AI and Design Engineering: A Symbiotic Relationship

The integration of AI into design engineering creates powerful synergies:

- **Prototyping with AI**: AI-driven tools like ChatGPT assist in generating content for prototypes, accelerating the design process.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Engineers use AI to predict performance issues and optimize designs in real-time.
- **Accessibility Improvements**: AI tools automatically detect and fix accessibility concerns, ensuring compliance.

### Case Study: Motion-Primitives

Motion-Primitives demonstrates how AI and design engineering come together. By leveraging Framer Motion and Tailwind CSS, it simplifies the creation of dynamic, responsive interfaces. AI can enhance this by:

- Generating motion patterns based on user preferences.
- Optimizing performance for different devices.
- Automating testing for cross-browser compatibility.

---

## Conclusion

The intersection of AI, design, and design engineering is reshaping the industry. By embracing AI while staying grounded in design principles, professionals can push boundaries and create experiences that are both innovative and human-centered. The future lies in collaboration—not only between humans and machines but also among designers, engineers, and AI.
