> # ERP

<Indent>
As a programming intern, I was assigned to maintain and develop an order management system used by a number of factories in different countries. The application wasn't weighed down with unnecessarily complex solutions but had to offer speed and reliability to users at the point of delivery, something that was a challenging feat to achieve with its bloated WordPress technology stack.
Task to modernize it came to it's boiling point and we had to take action, so we decided to completely dump old frontend in favour of something new. That's how this project started.

## What I Did

- Migrated all necessary backend functionality to use REST api following all possible best practices.
- Created a scalable, fast and responsive react application with focus on displaying heavy data efficiently.
- Researched slow load times and refactored complex data structures to improve speed and maintainability.
- Developed a lot of code-heavy solutions including a full-blown drive with permissions, chat, subscriptions systems.
- Create CI/CD solutions to optimize code flow and provide stable experience for end users.

## End Result
System is actively running and continues to improve without major tech debt. After years of active work users get to use seamless product with bright future.

> # ERP Subscription System

<Indent>
Time went by and business decided to scale. That's when we had to create a subscription solution so new users can control their systems single-handedly.

## What I Did

- Developed a system that created custom websites with selected subdomains for every user.
- Employed Stripe to deploy systems with selected plan restrictions for every client.
- Created comfortable and trustworthy experience by saving preferences, payment sessions, and using all collected data to make payment as intuitive as possible.
